    <h3>Who am I?</h3>
    <div class="whointrobox">
    <p style="font-size: large;">I'm an engineering student, programmer, 3d-artist, illustrator, musician and aspiring entreprenour from Finland. I have always dreamed of working at an innovative Silicon Valley startup. I'm facinated by tech, startups, math, physics, science, sowtware, lean, psychology and history.</p>

    <!--<p style="margin-top: 0px;">Figure 1. A world of wonders.</p>-->
    <h3>Programming</h3>
    <div class="whointrobox">
        <p>I started programming at age 14. I can write programming and scripting languages like: python, html, css, javascript, java, xml, c#, Visual Basic and many others. I can also do some PLC-programming particulary using languages like ST and FBD using an environment like Codesys. I also have little bit of experience with node.js and opc ua.</p>
        <p>I made a sheet based music app for android called BoxSound420. This app contains around 6000 lines of html, css and javascript and hundreds of lines of java and xml. I made the app in android studio but obviously Apache Cordova and React Native etc. could have also been used. </p>
        <p>I also made a mobile app called FastRead that enables people to read PDF-books extremely fast because the words are presented individually on the screen, thus eliminating excess time spent on eye movement. This app was made using java and Android Studio.</p>
        <p>I'm also working on couple games in the unity engine and my own new type of social media app. Stay tuned for more!</p>

    <h3>3d-art/modelling</h3>
    <p>I have extenssive experience using blender. I can create highly realistic textured objects and scenes that can be used in games, art, movies etc. I mostly get my textures from textures.com</p>
    <p>I can also do complex modelling and simulations in cad programs like Solid Edge & keyshot, Creo Parametric, AutoCAD, etc. I can model parts, assemblies and design engineering blueprints.</p>
    <img style="border-radius: 8px;" src="Modellingwebpageimg.png" alt="null" width="1100px">
    <h3>Illustration</h3>
    <p>I have always been really good at understanding and drawing 3D-shapes and I taught people how to draw 3D-cars while I was at third grade. I can do realistic illustrations using paper or professional art programs like ibisPaint, Photoshop, Gimp and others.</p>
    <img style="border-radius: 8px;" src="Art01.jpg" alt="null" width="1100px">
    <h3>Music</h3>
    <p>I have made a lot of my own music using Waveform 11 wich is a professional level music software. My favorite VST-plugins are Synth 1, Surge and Vital. I have also used tools like Caustic, Bosca Ceoili and my own music app BoxSound420.</p>
    <img style="border-radius: 8px;" src="Instruments01.png" alt="null" width="1100px">
    <h3>Engineering and work experience</h3>
    <p>In the summer of 2022 I had an internship at Valmet flow laboratory where I conducted testing and reporting on the performance of valves and pneumatic actuators.
        <br>
        <br>During my work I wrote a test program that reduced the theoretical testing time of one endurance test by 150 days.
        <br>I also made significant Visual Basic improvements to the workload input and workload analysis Excel-files used at Helsinki and Shanghai laboratories.
        <br>During my work I also developed an Excel VBA program for analyzing the average quarterly and annual project times, wich will help Valmet in their goal of reducing their average valve R&D project times by up to 20%. <br><br>I also spent two summers working at the Neles machine shop. During my work I mostly operated a Mazak lathe with mazatrol NC-control and Frömag broaching machine. I machined tough materials like acid resistant steel and spray coatings like NiBo (Nickel Boron) I also briefly used a Cazeneuve branded manual lathe for basic workpiece preparation work. The smallest tolerances were as low as 2μm</p>
    <p>In the future I want to work in the US tech industry in Silicon Valley. (Please see see the contact button at the top of the page.) I want to work at an innovative silicon valley startup that aims to change the world and I want to build useful products and services for as many people as possible. Indeed, I consider helping people to be the most satisfying thing in the world. Because we are here only for so long it's the legacy that we leave behind that matters.</p>
    <img style="border-radius: 8px;" src="Engineering01.jpg" alt="null" width="1100px">
    <h3>Studies</h3>
    <p>I'm majoring in mechanical- and minoring in electrical engineering at Aalto University in Espoo Finland. In the future I plan to learn more computer science, accounting and leadership.</p>
    <img style="border-radius: 8px;" src="AaltoUniversity01.jpg" alt="null" width="500px">
    <h3>Books & Mindset</h3>
    <p>I believe reading books is important and the best books are the ones we use for self developmet. I have read many books about Silicon Valley founders and believe building a strong mindset for the future is incredibly important - it ennables us to create an exciting new chapter for humanity. This Is what I call the theory of controlled influence.</p>
